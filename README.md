# Ansible role `vsftpd`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wimpunk/ansible-role-vsftpd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-vsftpd)

An Ansible role for setting up Vsftpd under CentOS/RHEL 6-7, Fedora 26, Ubuntu LTS 12.04 (precise) / 14.04 (trusty), or Debian 8 (Jessie) and 9 (Stretch). Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- install necessary packages
- manage configuration
- manage SELinux settings, when it is enabled

Configuring the firewall is outside the scope of this role. Use another role suitable for your distribution, e.g. [bertvv.rh-base](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/rh-base).

**If you like/use this role, please consider giving it a star. Thanks!**

## Role Variables

Please refer to the [vsftpd.conf(5)](http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html) man page for detailed info on the variables listed below. The variable names here are consistent with the Vsftpd configuration parameters.

| `vsftpd_group`                | root    | Group that will own `anon_root` and `local_root`                                            |
| `vsftpd_listen`               | true    | When enabled, run `vsftpd` in standalone mode. Mutually exclusive with `vsftpd_listen_ipv6` |
| `vsftpd_listen_ipv6`          | false   | When enabled, run `vsftpd` in standalone mode, over IPv6.                                   |
| `vsftpd_local_enable`         | false   | Specifies whether logins from registered users are permitted or not.                        |
| `vsftpd_local_root`           | -       | Directory for registered users. Defaults to their home directory.                           |
| `vsftpd_local_umask`          | 022     | The value that the umask for file creation is set to for local users.                       |
| `vsftpd_options`              | -       | List of dicts for other options not available as role variables. See below.                 |
| `vsftpd_owner`                | root    | User that will own `anon_root` and `local_root`                                             |

| `vsftpd_write_enable`         | true    | Controls whether any FTP commands which change the filesystem are allowed or not.           |

Vsftpd options not provided in the list above can be added with `vsftpd_options` as a list of dicts with two fields, `key` and `value`. **Remark** that boolean options should be specified with `'YES'` or `'NO` *within quotes*. Otherwise the Jinja template engine will interpret these values as booleans instead of strings an translate them into, "True" and "False", respectively.

```Yaml
vsftpd_options:
  - key: xferlog_enable
    value: 'YES'
  - key: xferlog_file
    value: /var/log/vsftp_xfer.log
```

Since vsftpd is dependent on fixed ACL permissions on the system this is in most cases easy to set but there are cases where a specific group needs access to some folders that can't be set when simply using chmod. In this case it is needed to add some extra read/write permissions for the specific user/group.
For this scenario it is possible to use the underlying variables in your playbook which will set these extra ACL entries.

```Yaml
vsftpd_extra_permissions:
  - folder: "/srv/shares/sales"
    entity: "management"
    etype: "group"
    permissions: "r-x"
```

## Dependencies

No dependencies.

## Example Playbook

See the test playbooks in either the [Vagrant](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-vsftpd/blob/vagrant-tests/test.yml) or [Docker](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-vsftpd/blob/docker-tests/test.yml) test environment. See the section Testing for details.

## Testing

There are two types of test environments available. One powered by Vagrant, another by Docker. The latter is suitable for running automated tests on Travis-CI. Test code is kept in separate orphan branches. For details of how to set up these test environments on your own machine, see the README files in the respective branches:

- Vagrant: [vagrant-tests](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-vsftpd/tree/vagrant-tests)
- Docker: [docker-tests](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-vsftpd/tree/docker-tests)

## Contributing
